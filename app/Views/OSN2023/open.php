  <h3 id="problems-types">Problems Types</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>There are 3 possible problem types. Not all problem types might be given.</li>
    <li><strong>Batch</strong> problems:
      <ul>
        <li>The most common problem type.</li>
        <li>Given an input, contestants write a program that reads input from <strong>stdin</strong> and writes output to <strong>stdout</strong>.</li>
        <li>The program must run within the given time and memory limits.</li>
        <li>Example: <a href="https://tlx.toki.id/problems/osn-2018/1C">Online Ojek, OSN 2018</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Interactive</strong> problems:
      <ul>
        <li>Contestants write a program that interacts with judge's program: judge's program writes to <strong>stdout</strong> and is given as the <strong>stdin</strong> for contestant's program, then contestant's program writes to <strong>stdout</strong> and is given as the <strong>stdin</strong> for judge's program, and the interaction continues until a given goal is reached.</li>
        <li>Contestant's program must output the answer within the given time and memory limits.</li>
        <li>Example: <a href="https://tlx.toki.id/problems/osn-2019/2B">Detecting Gold, OSN 2019</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Output-only</strong> problems:
      <ul>
        <li>Contestants will be given all the input test cases.</li>
        <li>Contestants submit <strong>output</strong> for each input test case.</li>
        <li>Contestants <strong>do not have to</strong> write a program; the outputs may be solved manually.</li>
        <li>Example: <a href="https://tlx.toki.id/problems/osn-2019/1C">OSN Excursion, OSN 2019</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="problem-scoring">Problem Scoring</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>There are two types of scoring: <strong>standard</strong> and <strong>creative</strong>.</li>
    <li>Creative problems will be stated explicitly in the problem description.</li>
    <li><strong>Standard</strong> scoring:
      <ul>
        <li>For batch and interactive problems:
          <ul>
            <li>A problem consists of <strong>multiple subtasks</strong> with various points.</li>
            <li>A subtask consists of <strong>multiple test cases</strong> that are grouped into some <strong>test groups</strong>.</li>
            <li>A submission gets a subtask's points if it solves <strong>all of its test groups</strong>.</li>
            <li>To solve a test group, a submission has to solve <strong>all of its test cases</strong>.</li>
            <li>A problem may have <strong>open subtasks</strong> where the test cases are given to contestants.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For output-only problems:
          <ul>
            <li>A problem consists of <strong>multiple test cases</strong> with various points.</li>
            <li>A submission gets the test case's points if it produces the correct output.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Creative</strong> scoring:
      <ul>
        <li>The scoring formula will vary for each problem and will be explicitly stated in the problem description.</li>
        <li>Example:
          <ul>
            <li>Batch: <a href="https://tlx.toki.id/problems/osn-2013/0C">Tukar-Tukar, OSN 2013</a>.</li>
            <li>Interactive: <a href="https://tlx.toki.id/problems/ksn-2020/2C">Finding Balls, KSN 2020</a>.</li>
            <li>Output-only: <a href="https://tlx.toki.id/problems/ksn-2020/1A">National Defence, KSN 2020</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="contestant-scoring">Contestant Scoring</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>For batch and interactive problems:
      <ul>
        <li>On creative scoring, for each submission, the score of a subtask is the minimum score among all its test cases.</li>
        <li>A subtask final score is the <strong>maximum of its score</strong> among all submissions.</li>
        <li>Contestant's score for a problem is the sum of all its subtasks final score.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For example, if the first submission got 30 points for the first subtask and 0 points for the second subtask, and the second submission got 0 points for the first subtask and 40 points for the second subtask, then the contestant's score for the problem is 70 points.</p>
    </li>
    <li>For output-only problems:
      <ul>
        <li>A test case final score is the <strong>maximum of its score</strong> among all submissions.</li>
        <li>A contestant's score on a problem is the sum of all its test cases final score.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A contestant's total score is the sum of <strong>all of problems score</strong> on <strong>both competition days</strong>.</li>
    <li>Contestants will be ranked by the total score (descending).</li>
    <li>Two contestants with <strong>the same</strong> total score will achieve <strong>the same</strong> rank.</li>
    <li>Submission time <strong>will not affect</strong> contestant rank at all.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h3 id="grading-system">Grading System</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://tlx.toki.id">TLX</a> will be used as the grading system.</li>
    <li>Source code limit for each submission is <strong>300 KB</strong>.</li>
    <li>For each test case, the grader will output one of:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AC</strong> (Accepted): program solved the problem within the given time and memory limits.</li>
        <li><strong>WA</strong> (Wrong Answer): program stopped within given time and memory limits, but produced the wrong output.</li>
        <li><strong>RTE</strong> (Runtime Error): program crashed or exceedeed the memory limit.</li>
        <li><strong>TLE</strong> (Time Limit Exceeded): program exceeded the time limit.</li>
        <li>Skipped: test case is not graded because there was a test case in the same subtask that was not solved.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
